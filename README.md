Tasks for CODSOFT Internship - April 2025

# Task 1 - Titanic Survival Prediction
This project is part of the CODSOFT Internship. It focuses on predicting whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using a machine learning model trained on historical data.

# Problem Statement
Given data on Titanic passengers (such as age, sex, ticket class, etc.), the goal is to build a model that predicts survival.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Streamlit (for deployment)
- TensorFlow/Keras (for model)
- CSV dataset

# Files Included
- app.py – Streamlit web app
- Titanic-Dataset.csv – Dataset used for training
  (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
- model.h5 – Trained model (saved using Keras)
  (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NtH64pSqJUoiI4qy6UH_V-_4JwLk9r3u)
- screenshots – Output screenshots of the app

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras (for neural network)
- Streamlit (for interactive UI)
- CSV dataset

# Files Included

  # Task 3 - Iris Flower Species Prediction
This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict the species of an Iris flower based on its features. The model is trained using the Iris dataset, and an interactive Streamlit UI is used to make real-time predictions.

# Problem Statement
Given the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of an Iris flower, the goal is to predict the species of the flower using a trained machine learning model.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Scikit-learn: For training the machine learning model.
- Streamlit: For building the interactive user interface.
- Joblib: For saving and loading the trained model and label encoder.

# Files Included
- app.py – Streamlit web app
- IRIS.csv – Dataset used for training
