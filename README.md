Tasks for CODSOFT Internship - April 2025

# Task 1 - Titanic Survival Prediction
This project is part of the CODSOFT Internship. It focuses on predicting whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using a machine learning model trained on historical data.

# Problem Statement
Given data on Titanic passengers (such as age, sex, ticket class, etc.), the goal is to build a model that predicts survival.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
- Streamlit (for deployment)
- TensorFlow/Keras (for model)
- CSV dataset

# Files Included
- app.py – Streamlit web app
- Titanic-Dataset.csv – Dataset used for training
  (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset)
- model.h5 – Trained model (saved using Keras)
  (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NtH64pSqJUoiI4qy6UH_V-_4JwLk9r3u)
- screenshots – Output screenshots of the app 

# Model Accuracy
Achieved **81.01% accuracy** on test data 

# Output
- Interface - Interface.png
- Not-survived - Not-survived.png
- Survived - Survived.png

# Task 2 - Movie Rating Prediction
This project aims to predict IMDb movie ratings using a machine learning model. The model is trained using features like genre, director, and actors, and it is deployed with an interactive Streamlit UI for real-time prediction.

# Problem Statement
Given the metadata of a movie (genre, director, and actors), the goal is to predict the IMDb rating of the movie using a trained neural network model.

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras (for neural network)
- Streamlit (for interactive UI)
- CSV dataset


# Files Included
